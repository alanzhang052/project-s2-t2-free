## Action item

* a goal: Keep each other updated on the tutorials we are going through and create documentation for the application.
* a change: Create a Shared Google Drive for the team to share notes / documentation from tutorials
* a measurement: The TutorialProgress spreadsheet will help make us accountable for the tutorials we have completed.

## Retro Assessment

* My team and I followed the Start/Stop/Continue template for our first retro using GroupMaps to outline our thoughts and feelings about this process so far.
* I think it went relatively well. We were able to identify pretty quickly that we all wanted to continue working through tutorials, but needed a way of consolidating all the information we're learning. Based on my team's concerns, I create a Google Folder with an excel file labeled TutorialProgress and shared it with the rest of my team.
* I would recommend figuring out what template you want to follow beforehand since I think it helped even if we didn't use it extensively.
