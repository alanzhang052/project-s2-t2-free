# Team Agreements

* ecided to make repo public (open source under MIT license).
* When one of us is absent for an unavoidable reason, we will let the other team members know on the team slack channel, 
in advance when possible, as soon as possible afterwards when not.
* We will each try to keep such absences to a minimum.
* Those of us that are present will do our best to share with the absent team member(s) what they missed and help them get 
back up to speed.
* We will all do our best to contribute to the teams success.
* Discuss disputes on Zoom over Slack. (/zoom)
* Team Meetings: during class times for now
* Tech Stack: NextJS
