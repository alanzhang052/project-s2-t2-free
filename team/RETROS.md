# Retro 04/20/20

- Led by: Clare Boyle
- Present: Corey Su, Ishana Narayanan, Vincent Tieu
- Absent: --

## Action item

- a goal: Keep each other updated on the tutorials we are going through and create documentation for the application.
- a change: Create a Shared Google Drive for the team to share notes / documentation from tutorials
- a measurement: The TutorialProgress spreadsheet will help make us accountable for the tutorials we have completed.

## Retro Assessment

- My team and I followed the Start/Stop/Continue template for our first retro using GroupMaps to outline our thoughts and feelings about this process so far.
- I think it went relatively well. We were able to identify pretty quickly that we all wanted to continue working through tutorials, but needed a way of consolidating all the information we're learning. Based on my team's concerns, I create a Google Folder with an excel file labeled TutorialProgress and shared it with the rest of my team.
- I would recommend figuring out what template you want to follow beforehand since I think it helped even if we didn't use it extensively.

## Action item

- a goal: Create a better way to prepare / create issues for future implementations of our app
- a change: Drawing out / writing out plans on pen and paper (or some other method) then sending a photo on Slack
- a measurement: During sprint meetings take on new issues and review progress at end of sprint time-span

## Brief description of how retro went

Retro leader fill this in.

- My team and I followed the Start/Stop/Continue template for this retro.
- I think this retro went relatively well as we were able to talk among each other about things that were useful to us (ex. continuing peer programming) and things that weren't and should be stopped (ex. tutorial spreadsheet). We were able to address these things and document them in our shared Google Drive.
- I would recommend the next person leading the retro to keep the meeting focused on team dynamics and have other discussions saved for a future standup meeting or for a separate call.

## Retro Assessment
