## Sprint Goal for Monday 04/27 through Monday 05/04

Our goal is to complete a partial completion of our MVP. We plan on using a pre-existing calendar API to allow our users to input their schedule.

## Brief description of MVP

Our App's MVP focuses on allowing a user to input their schedule and join groups with other users. When in a group, the app will compare everyone's schedules and return the free time.

## Production App placeholder

<https://cs48-s20-s2-t2-prod.herokuapp.com/>

* Team is on track to complete production app placeholder by noon Thursday (04/30/2020)

## MVP Status

* Team is concerned that it might not be able to complete MVP by noon a week from Thursday (05/07/2020)

(If applicable, include items below.)

What obstacles remain to completing MVP:
* Finding/creating a suitable calendar interface
* Generating shareable links
* Using a database to save a user's schedule

Support that would be helpful from course staff to completing MVP
* APIs that would be compatible with our product (considering Google Calendar API if possible)
* MongoDB resources
