## Sprint Goal for 05/12-05/21

Which of the 10 powerful questions did you ask?

- 5. Which steps are required to achieve this Sprint Goal? Which are the least required or could we do without if we really have to?
- 8. What would need to happen while working on this Sprint Goal that would be cause for celebration?
- 9. What worry about our product is keeping you up at night? What can we build or test this Sprint to make you sleep a bit better?

Describe your sprint goal here.

- Discussed about adding more features in the "My Schedule," "Groups," "Group Management Pages." Assigned roles to important features and gave rough deadlines.

Describe briefly how you came up with that goal.

- First, we talked about our concerns on the Google Spreadsheet. Then we listed all the features that we want to get done and assigned difficulty and priority values to each of the features. Finally, we talked about assigning everyone to at least one feature.

## Discussion of previous Sprint Goal

Briefly: was the sprint goal acheived? Was it too ambitious? Too modest?

- Discussed features we should stop planning to do. Using Calendar API and UCSB API would be too difficult and not worth it considering our limited time deadlines.

# Status, Monday 04/27/2020

## Sprint Goal for Monday 04/27 through Monday 05/04

Our goal is to complete a partial completion of our MVP. We plan on using a pre-existing calendar API to allow our users to input their schedule.

## Brief description of MVP

Our App's MVP focuses on allowing a user to input their schedule and join groups with other users. When in a group, the app will compare everyone's schedules and return the free time.

## Production App placeholder

<https://cs48-s20-s2-t2-prod.herokuapp.com/>

- Team is on track to complete production app placeholder by noon Thursday (04/30/2020)

## MVP Status

- Team is concerned that it might not be able to complete MVP by noon a week from Thursday (05/07/2020)

(If applicable, include items below.)

What obstacles remain to completing MVP:

- Finding/creating a suitable calendar interface
- Generating shareable links
- Using a database to save a user's schedule

Support that would be helpful from course staff to completing MVP

- APIs that would be compatible with our product (considering Google Calendar API if possible)
- MongoDB resources
